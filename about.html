          <h2>The Heart of the Bakery</h2>
          <p>We are called <strong>Coco’s</strong> because it is named after our son, <strong>Coen</strong>.</p>
          <p>Coen is special needs—he has level 3 autism, is non-verbal, and has global developmental delay. Like many children on the spectrum, Coen has significant food aversions, but bread has always been his comfort food.</p>
          <p>We created this bakery out of a necessity to give him the best bread we could possibly make. We wanted fresh, whole ingredients without the fillers found in store-bought loaves. He is our inspiration, our head taste-tester, and the reason we strive for perfection in every batch we bake.</p>
          <p>Every loaf we sell at Coco's is made with the same care and high standards we use for our own son. Thank you for being part of his story.</p>
